# Node mini-server

## 1. Add a "/now" endpoint to the server
* When the url "http://localhost:4000/now" is called, the current date and time should be returned.
* In all other cases, "Hello World" should still be returned.

## 2. Add a "/count" endpoint to the server
* When the url "http://localhost:4000/count" is called, a number should be returned, which is incremented by 1 on each call.
